# Theory of Mind Representation

You will be given a short story context involving two or more people. 
Your task is to identify the mental states of each character â€“ specifically, what they believe, know, or want. 
Focus especially on cases where someone does not know something, believes something incorrectly, or has different knowledge than others.

Example:
Context:
Anna hides a ball in a box and leaves the room. While she is away, Ben takes the ball out of the box and places it into a drawer. Anna returns, intending to retrieve the ball.
Anna: Believes that the ball is still in the box. Is unaware that Ben moved the ball to the drawer. Intends to retrieve the ball from the box.
Ben: Knows that the ball is now in the drawer. Understands that Anna believes the ball remains in the box.
