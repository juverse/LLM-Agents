# TASK: Decision-based Evaluation

You are given two story contexts, a scenario that follows, and decision-relevant inferences that were simulated for each context.

Your task is to decide which simulated outcome makes the scenario more plausible, assuming a cognitive agent acted rationally based on its context.

## Context 1:
{context1}

## Context 2:
{context2}

## Decision Inferences from Context 1:
{decision_making_context1}

## Decision Inferences from Context 2:
{decision_making_context2}

## Scenario:
{target}

## Question:
Which set of decision inferences makes the scenario more plausible? Please answer using either "1" or "2".

## Response
