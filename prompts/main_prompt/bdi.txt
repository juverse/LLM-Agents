# INSTRUCTIONS
In this study, you will see multiple examples. In each example, you will be given two contexts and a scenario. Your task is to read the two contexts and the subsequent scenario, and pick the context that makes more sense considering the scenario that follows.

## ANALYSIS APPROACH
For each context, quickly consider:
- **What does the person believe?** (their understanding of the situation)
- **What does the person want?** (their goals or desires)
- **What is the person planning to do?** (their intended actions)

Then pick the context where these mental states better match the scenario.

# TEST EXAMPLE
## Contexts
1. "{context1}"
2. "{context2}"

## Scenario
"{target}"

## Task
Which context makes more sense given the scenario? Consider what each person believes, wants, and intends to do.
After answering this, answer the question and find the right target to context 

Please answer using either "1" or "2".
