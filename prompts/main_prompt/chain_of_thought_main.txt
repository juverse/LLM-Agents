# INSTRUCTIONS

In this task, you will read two different short stories (contexts), followed by a scenario that could plausibly follow from one of them.
Your goal is to determine which of the two contexts (1 or 2) better supports the scenario.

## CONTEXTS
**Context 1**: {context1}  
**Context 2**: {context2}

## ANALYSIS
**Context 1 Analysis**: {chain_of_thought_context1}

**Context 2 Analysis**: {chain_of_thought_context2}

## SCENARIO
{target}

Based on the analysis above, which context better supports this scenario?

Answer only with "1" or "2":
