# INSTRUCTIONS

In this task, you will read two different short stories (contexts), followed by a scenario that could plausibly follow from one of them.
Your goal is to determine which of the two contexts (1 or 2) better supports the scenario.

## TASK EXAMPLE
### Contexts
**Context 1**: {context1}  
**Context 2**: {context2}

### Scenario
{target}

# TASK
Let’s think step by step:
1. What key beliefs or facts are relevant in each context?
2. What might the agent(s) in each context want or intend to do?
3. How might they act, and which of those actions would make the given scenario more likely?

Use these reflections to compare the two situations. Then, choose the context that best supports the scenario.

### Final Answer (respond only with “1” or “2”):
