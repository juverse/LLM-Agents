# INSTRUCTIONS

In this task, you will be presented with two contexts describing different situations, followed by a scenario that could plausibly follow one of them. Your job is to determine which context more plausibly leads to the given scenario.

To help with your decision, we provide three cognitive components for each context:
1. Working Memory: The key beliefs and facts an intelligent agent would hold based on the context.
3. Decision Making: A high-level evaluation of how the context might influence future actions or outcomes.

Please read all the information carefully and choose the context (1 or 2) that better supports the scenario based on the provided cognitive interpretations.

## Cognitive Module Outputs:

### Working Memory
1.{working_memory2_context1}  
2.{working_memory2_context2}

### Decision-Making
1.{decision_making2_context1}  
2.{decision_making2_context2}

## TEST EXAMPLE

### Contexts
1. {context1}  
2. {context2}

### Scenario
{target}

## TASK

Which context better supports the scenario, given the cognitive interpretations above? Please answer with "1" or "2".
