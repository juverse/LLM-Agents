# INSTRUCTIONS
You are given two contexts, a target statement, and a propositional logic interpretation of each context. Your task is to determine which context makes the target belief more plausible based on the facts and reasoning.

## Contexts
1. "{context1}"
2. "{context2}"

## Propositional Logic Interpretation
Context 1 Logic:
{propositional_logic_context1}

Context 2 Logic:
{propositional_logic_context2}

## Target Statement
"{target}"

## Task
Based on the logical reasoning and the content of the contexts, which context better supports the target statement?  
Answer only with "1" or "2".
