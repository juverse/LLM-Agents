Answer: [1 or 2]"," The given scenario states that Li believes the cooler is in the hospital. If the belief of Li is based on the actual perceptual state (what Li sees), then it is more likely that Li is in the hospital and sees the cooler inside, rather than seeing it outside.

""Ali chooses Jesse over Wei.""

**Task**: Which context (1 or 2) better shows understanding of people's mental states?

Answer: [1 or 2]"," The context ""Ali hates Wei less than Jesse"" better shows understanding of people's mental states in this scenario because the choice of Wei over Jesse implies that the dislike for Wei is less than the dislike for Jesse, aligning with the given context.

To understand Ali's choice, we would need to consider additional factors beyond just the comparison of hatred towards Wei and Jesse.

In this context, it's reasonable to believe that they both believe they are working together, they want to achieve a common goal, and they will continue to cooperate.

So"," The context ""Mohammed and Carmen are helping each other"" would not be an accurate reflection of the scenario where Mohammed is competing with Carmen. In this context, it shows that they are working together, which is not the case when Mohammed is in competition with Carmen.

**Task**: Which context (1 or 2) better shows understanding of people's mental states?

Answer: [1 or 2]"," To determine which context better shows understanding of people's mental states, we should consider what Jesse might be thinking and feeling when cooperating with Alex. If cooperating implies supporting or helping Alex, it is reasonable to assume that Jesse will, in general, be happy if Alex succeeds. On the other hand, while Jesse might not necessarily aim for Alex to fail, he is not unhappy about Alex succeeding, but rather fulfilled by their cooperation.

Hence, the answer would be"," The context ""Jesse will be happy if Alex succeeds"" better shows understanding of people's mental states because it indicates Jesse's positive emotion towards Alex's success, suggesting that Jesse wants Alex to succeed. However, the second context implies a less positive attitude from Jesse as it suggests he might feel happiness if Alex fails, which could indicate jealousy, competitiveness, or other negative emotions. In a race or competition, people generally wish for their competition to fail only if they themselves",--max_items 150 --main_prompt tom_main

""Jesse is chasing Alex.""

**Task**: Which context (1 or 2) better shows understanding of people's mental states?

Answer: [1 or 2]"," The context ""Jesse is avoiding Alex"" better shows understanding of people's mental states in the given scenario. This is because avoiding someone often indicates an aversion, fear, or unwillingness to approach them, which seems to align with the concept of ""evading"" in the provided scenario. On the other hand, 'following' someone usually suggests a willingness or obligation to stay near them, which seems less aligned with the idea of ""evading""."," 1. ""Jesse is avoiding Alex."" would be a better fit as it seems to more accurately describe the mental states of both individuals. It implies that Alex may believe Jesse is chasing him (or unsuspectingly running away) and Jesse desires to not be with Alex (or has a reason to chase), but is intentionally avoiding him. In contrast, ""Jesse is following Alex"" implies a different intention from Jesse, possibly out of interest or obligation, rather than avoiding him",--max_items 150 --main_prompt tom_main

**Task**: Which context (1 or 2) better shows understanding of people's mental states?

Answer: [1 or 2]"," The context ""Mohammed enjoys large gatherings"" better shows understanding of Mohammed's mental state because it pertains to his preference for social situations, which aligns with being extroverted. It suggests that Mohammed likes being surrounded by many people, a trait characteristic of extroverts. The other context, ""Mohammed enjoys intimate gatherings,"" is more about small-scale social gatherings, which may not be reflective of an extroverted personality as ext"," The context that better shows understanding of people's mental states is context 2: ""Mohammed enjoys intimate gatherings.""
