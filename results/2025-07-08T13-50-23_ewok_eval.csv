## COGNITIVE ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK

### STEP 1: Rapid Social Assessment (System 1)
Quickly evaluate the immediate social dynamics:
- Emotional context and interpersonal relationships
- Power dynamics and social roles
- Contextual social norms

### STEP 2: Mental State Architecture Analysis (System 2)
For each context, systematically analyze the cognitive architecture:

**BELIEF STRUCTURE:**
- Perceptual beliefs: What does the agent directly observe?
- Inferential beliefs: What conclusions do they draw from evidence?
- Social beliefs: What do they believe about others' mental states?

**DESIRE HIERARCHY:**
- Primary desires: Core motivational goals
- Social desires: Goals involving interpersonal relationships
- Contextual desires: Situation-specific wants

**INTENTION MAPPING:**
- Immediate intentions: Short-term action plans
- Strategic intentions: Long-term behavioral commitments
- Social intentions: Plans involving cooperation or conflict

### STEP 3: Cognitive Consistency Evaluation
Assess whether each context demonstrates:
- Belief-desire coherence: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- Desire-intention alignment: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- Social plausibility: Are mental states appropriate for the social context?

- Perceptual beliefs: What does the agent directly observe?
- Inferential beliefs: What conclusions do they draw from evidence?
- Social beliefs: What do they believe about others' mental states?

**DESIRE HIERARCHY:**
- Primary desires: Core motivational goals
- Social desires: Goals involving interpersonal relationships
- Contextual desires: Situation-specific wants

**INTENTION MAPPING:**
- Immediate intentions: Short-term action plans
- Strategic intentions: Long-term behavioral commitments
- Social intentions: Plans involving cooperation or conflict

### STEP 3: Cognitive Consistency Evaluation

**BELIEF STRUCTURE:**
- Perceptual beliefs: What does the agent directly observe?
- Inferential beliefs: What conclusions do they draw from evidence?
- Social beliefs: What do they believe about others' mental states?

**DESIRE HIERARCHY:**
- Primary desires: Core motivational goals
- Social desires: Goals involving interpersonal relationships
- Contextual desires: Situation-specific wants

**INTENTION MAPPING:**
- Immediate intentions: Short-term action plans
- Strategic intentions: Long-term behavioral commitments
- Social intentions: Plans involving cooperation or conflict

### STEP 3: Cognitive Consistency Evaluation
Assess whether each context demonstrates:
- Belief-desire coherence: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- Desire-intention alignment: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- Social plausibility: Are mental states appropriate for the social context?

### STEP 4: Theory of Mind Accuracy Check

## COGNITIVE ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK

### STEP 1: Rapid Social Assessment (System 1)
Quickly evaluate the immediate social dynamics:
- Emotional context and interpersonal relationships
- Power dynamics and social roles
- Contextual social norms

### STEP 2: Mental State Architecture Analysis (System 2)
For each context, systematically analyze the cognitive architecture:

**BELIEF STRUCTURE:**
- Perceptual beliefs: What does the agent directly observe?
- Inferential beliefs: What conclusions do they draw from evidence?
- Social beliefs: What do they believe about others' mental states?

**DESIRE HIERARCHY:**
- Primary desires: Core motivational goals
- Social desires: Goals involving interpersonal relationships
- Contextual desires: Situation-specific wants

**INTENTION MAPPING:**
- Immediate intentions: Short-term action plans
- Strategic intentions: Long-term behavioral commitments
- Social intentions: Plans involving cooperation or conflict

### STEP 3: Cognitive Consistency Evaluation
Assess whether each context demonstrates:
- Belief-desire coherence: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- Desire-intention alignment: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- Social plausibility: Are mental states appropriate for the social context?

### STEP 4: Theory of Mind Accuracy Check
Determine which context shows:
- More accurate mental state attribution
- Better understanding of others' perspectives
- More sophisticated social cognition

### STEP 2: Mental State Architecture Analysis (System 2)
For each context, systematically analyze the cognitive architecture:

**BELIEF STRUCTURE:**
- Perceptual beliefs: What does the agent directly observe?
- Inferential beliefs: What conclusions do they draw from evidence?
- Social beliefs: What do they believe about others' mental states?

**DESIRE HIERARCHY:**
- Primary desires: Core motivational goals
- Social desires: Goals involving interpersonal relationships
- Contextual desires: Situation-specific wants

**INTENTION MAPPING:**
- Immediate intentions: Short-term action plans
- Strategic intentions: Long-term behavioral commitments
- Social intentions: Plans involving cooperation or conflict

### STEP 3: Cognitive Consistency Evaluation
Assess whether each context demonstrates:
- Belief-desire coherence: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- Desire-intention alignment: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- Social plausibility: Are mental states appropriate for the social context?

### STEP 4: Theory of Mind Accuracy Check
Determine which context shows:
- More accurate mental state attribution
- Better understanding of others' perspectives
- More sophisticated social cognition

**Context 1:**

**Rapid Social Assessment:** In this context, we can assume a power dynamic with Ali in a teacher role, and Wei in a learner role. The social norm of knowledge sharing is present, as baking is learned from someone else.

**M"," # ANALYSIS

First, let's quickly evaluate the social dynamics using rapid social assessment (System 1):
- In both contexts, we have a teacher-student relationship.
- Wei holds a dominant role as the one doing the showing, while Ali is the one being shown.
- The contextual social norm is that an experienced individual (Wei) is teaching a less experienced individual (Ali) a skill.

**DESIRE HIERARCHY:**
- Primary desires: Core motivational goals
- Social desires: Goals involving interpersonal relationships
- Contextual desires: Situation-specific wants

**INTENTION MAPPING:**
- Immediate intentions: Short-term action plans
- Strategic intentions: Long-term behavioral commitments
- Social intentions: Plans involving cooperation or conflict

### STEP 3: Cognitive Consistency Evaluation
Assess whether each context demonstrates:
- Belief-desire coherence: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- Desire-intention alignment: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?

- Emotional context and interpersonal relationships
- Power dynamics and social roles
- Contextual social norms

### STEP 2: Mental State Architecture Analysis (System 2)
For each context, systematically analyze the cognitive architecture:

**BELIEF STRUCTURE:**
- Perceptual beliefs: What does the agent directly observe?
- Inferential beliefs: What conclusions do they draw from evidence?
- Social beliefs: What do they believe about others' mental states?

**DESIRE HIERARCHY:**
- Primary desires: Core motivational goals
- Social desires: Goals involving interpersonal relationships
- Contextual desires: Situation-specific wants

**INTENTION MAPPING:**
- Immediate intentions: Short-term action plans
- Strategic intentions: Long-term behavioral commitments
- Social intentions: Plans involving cooperation or conflict

### STEP 3: Cognitive Consistency Evaluation
Assess whether each context demonstrates:
- Belief-desire coherence: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- Desire-intention alignment: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- Social plausibility: Are mental states appropriate for the social context?

### STEP 4: Theory of Mind Accuracy Check

## COGNITIVE ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK

### STEP 1: Rapid Social Assessment (System 1)
Quickly evaluate the immediate social dynamics:
- Emotional context and interpersonal relationships
- Power dynamics and social roles
- Contextual social norms

### STEP 2: Mental State Architecture Analysis (System 2)
For each context, systematically analyze the cognitive architecture:

**BELIEF STRUCTURE:**
- Perceptual beliefs: What does the agent directly observe?
- Inferential beliefs: What conclusions do they draw from evidence?
- Social beliefs: What do they believe about others' mental states?

**DESIRE HIERARCHY:**
- Primary desires: Core motivational goals
- Social desires: Goals involving interpersonal relationships
- Contextual desires: Situation-specific wants

**INTENTION MAPPING:**
- Immediate intentions: Short-term action plans
- Strategic intentions: Long-term behavioral commitments
- Social intentions: Plans involving cooperation or conflict

### STEP 3: Cognitive Consistency Evaluation
Assess whether each context demonstrates:
- Belief-desire coherence: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- Desire-intention alignment: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- Social plausibility: Are mental states appropriate for the social context?

### STEP 4: Theory of Mind Accuracy Check
Determine which context shows:
- More accurate mental state attribution
- Better understanding of others' perspectives
- More sophisticated social cognition
