## Scenario
""Jesse does not smell the cookie.""

## Task
Which context makes more sense given the scenario? Please answer using either ""1"" or ""2"".

## Response
",1,"21. **Analyze the Scenario:** ""Jesse does not smell the cookie."" This implies a lack of proximity or a barrier preventing the smell from reaching Jesse.

2. **Evaluate Context 1:** ""The cookie is in the same room as Jesse."" If the cookie is in the same room, it's generally expected that Jesse *would* smell it, especially if it's a strong-smelling cookie. This contradicts the scenario.

3. **Evaluate Context 2:** ""The cookie is in a different room than Jesse."" If the cookie is in a different room, there's a wall or door between Jesse and the cookie, making it much less likely for Jesse to smell it. This aligns with the scenario.

4. **Conclusion:** Context 2 makes more sense given the scenario.
