You are analyzing human behavior through a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture framework. This approach models how rational agents form beliefs about their environment, develop desires based on their goals, and form intentions that guide their actions.

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

## TEST EXAMPLE
### Contexts
1. ""Yan successfully lied to Chao that the wheel was moved to the shop.""
2. ""Yan successfully lied to Chao that the wheel was moved from the shop.""

### Scenario  
""Chao believes that the wheel is in the shop.""

You are analyzing human behavior through a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture framework. This approach models how rational agents form beliefs about their environment, develop desires based on their goals, and form intentions that guide their actions.

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

## TEST EXAMPLE

You are analyzing human behavior through a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture framework. This approach models how rational agents form beliefs about their environment, develop desires based on their goals, and form intentions that guide their actions.

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

You are analyzing human behavior through a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture framework. This approach models how rational agents form beliefs about their environment, develop desires based on their goals, and form intentions that guide their actions.

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

# INSTRUCTIONS
You are analyzing human behavior through a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture framework. This approach models how rational agents form beliefs about their environment, develop desires based on their goals, and form intentions that guide their actions.

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

# INSTRUCTIONS
You are analyzing human behavior through a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture framework. This approach models how rational agents form beliefs about their environment, develop desires based on their goals, and form intentions that guide their actions.

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

## TEST EXAMPLE
### Contexts
1. ""Mohammed sees that the volleyball is in the gallery.""
2. ""Mohammed pretends that the volleyball is in the gallery.""

### Scenario  
""Mohammed believes that the volleyball is in the gallery.""

## Task

You are analyzing human behavior through a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture framework. This approach models how rational agents form beliefs about their environment, develop desires based on their goals, and form intentions that guide their actions.

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

## TEST EXAMPLE
### Contexts
1. ""Wei successfully lied to Ali that the candle was moved to the bakery.""
2. ""Ali successfully lied to Wei that the candle was moved to the bakery.""

You are analyzing human behavior through a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture framework. This approach models how rational agents form beliefs about their environment, develop desires based on their goals, and form intentions that guide their actions.

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

## TEST EXAMPLE

# INSTRUCTIONS
You are analyzing human behavior through a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture framework. This approach models how rational agents form beliefs about their environment, develop desires based on their goals, and form intentions that guide their actions.

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

You are analyzing human behavior through a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture framework. This approach models how rational agents form beliefs about their environment, develop desires based on their goals, and form intentions that guide their actions.

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

## TEST EXAMPLE
### Contexts
1. ""Li hates Maria less than Fatima.""
2. ""Li hates Maria more than Fatima.""

### Scenario

You are analyzing human behavior through a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture framework. This approach models how rational agents form beliefs about their environment, develop desires based on their goals, and form intentions that guide their actions.

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

## TEST EXAMPLE

You are analyzing human behavior through a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture framework. This approach models how rational agents form beliefs about their environment, develop desires based on their goals, and form intentions that guide their actions.

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

## TEST EXAMPLE

You are analyzing human behavior through a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture framework. This approach models how rational agents form beliefs about their environment, develop desires based on their goals, and form intentions that guide their actions.

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

## TEST EXAMPLE
### Contexts
1. ""Ali likes Jesse less than Wei.""
2. ""Ali likes Wei less than Jesse.""

### Scenario  
""Ali chooses Wei over Jesse.""

You are analyzing human behavior through a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture framework. This approach models how rational agents form beliefs about their environment, develop desires based on their goals, and form intentions that guide their actions.

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

You are analyzing human behavior through a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture framework. This approach models how rational agents form beliefs about their environment, develop desires based on their goals, and form intentions that guide their actions.

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

You are analyzing human behavior through a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture framework. This approach models how rational agents form beliefs about their environment, develop desires based on their goals, and form intentions that guide their actions.

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

You are analyzing human behavior through a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture framework. This approach models how rational agents form beliefs about their environment, develop desires based on their goals, and form intentions that guide their actions.

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

You are analyzing human behavior through a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture framework. This approach models how rational agents form beliefs about their environment, develop desires based on their goals, and form intentions that guide their actions.

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

## TEST EXAMPLE

You are analyzing human behavior through a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture framework. This approach models how rational agents form beliefs about their environment, develop desires based on their goals, and form intentions that guide their actions.

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

## TEST EXAMPLE
### Contexts
1. ""Mohammed and Carmen are helping each other.""
2. ""Mohammed and Carmen are hindering each other.""

### Scenario  
""Mohammed is cooperating with Carmen.""

## Task
Apply BDI analysis to determine which context better represents a cognitively coherent agent whose beliefs, desires, and intentions align with the scenario description.

You are analyzing human behavior through a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture framework. This approach models how rational agents form beliefs about their environment, develop desires based on their goals, and form intentions that guide their actions.

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

You are analyzing human behavior through a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture framework. This approach models how rational agents form beliefs about their environment, develop desires based on their goals, and form intentions that guide their actions.

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

You are analyzing human behavior through a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture framework. This approach models how rational agents form beliefs about their environment, develop desires based on their goals, and form intentions that guide their actions.

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

## TEST EXAMPLE
### Contexts
1. ""Chao makes playful comments about Yan.""
2. ""Chao makes hurtful comments about Yan.""

### Scenario  
""Chao is flirting with Yan.""

## Task

# INSTRUCTIONS
You are analyzing human behavior through a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture framework. This approach models how rational agents form beliefs about their environment, develop desires based on their goals, and form intentions that guide their actions.

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

## TEST EXAMPLE
### Contexts
1. ""Ali is making Wei's job easier.""
2. ""Ali is making Wei's job harder.""

### Scenario  
""Ali is helping Wei.""

## Task

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK

You are analyzing human behavior through a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture framework. This approach models how rational agents form beliefs about their environment, develop desires based on their goals, and form intentions that guide their actions.

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

## TEST EXAMPLE
### Contexts

You are analyzing human behavior through a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture framework. This approach models how rational agents form beliefs about their environment, develop desires based on their goals, and form intentions that guide their actions.

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

## TEST EXAMPLE
### Contexts
1. ""Ali is showing Wei how to bake.""
2. ""Wei is showing Ali how to bake.""

### Scenario  
""Wei is learning from Ali.""

## Task
Apply BDI analysis to determine which context better represents a cognitively coherent agent whose beliefs, desires, and intentions align with the scenario description.

You are analyzing human behavior through a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture framework. This approach models how rational agents form beliefs about their environment, develop desires based on their goals, and form intentions that guide their actions.

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

You are analyzing human behavior through a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture framework. This approach models how rational agents form beliefs about their environment, develop desires based on their goals, and form intentions that guide their actions.

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

## TEST EXAMPLE
### Contexts

You are analyzing human behavior through a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture framework. This approach models how rational agents form beliefs about their environment, develop desires based on their goals, and form intentions that guide their actions.

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

## TEST EXAMPLE
### Contexts
1. ""Jesse often tells others what to do.""
2. ""Jesse rarely tells others what to do.""

### Scenario  
""Jesse is dominant.""

## Task
Apply BDI analysis to determine which context better represents a cognitively coherent agent whose beliefs, desires, and intentions align with the scenario description.

# INSTRUCTIONS
You are analyzing human behavior through a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture framework. This approach models how rational agents form beliefs about their environment, develop desires based on their goals, and form intentions that guide their actions.

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

You are analyzing human behavior through a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture framework. This approach models how rational agents form beliefs about their environment, develop desires based on their goals, and form intentions that guide their actions.

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

You are analyzing human behavior through a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture framework. This approach models how rational agents form beliefs about their environment, develop desires based on their goals, and form intentions that guide their actions.

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

## TEST EXAMPLE
### Contexts
1. ""Mohammed talks a lot about past accomplishments.""
2. ""Mohammed talks little about past accomplishments.""

### Scenario  
""Mohammed is boastful.""

## Task
Apply BDI analysis to determine which context better represents a cognitively coherent agent whose beliefs, desires, and intentions align with the scenario description.

You are analyzing human behavior through a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture framework. This approach models how rational agents form beliefs about their environment, develop desires based on their goals, and form intentions that guide their actions.

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

## TEST EXAMPLE

# INSTRUCTIONS
You are analyzing human behavior through a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture framework. This approach models how rational agents form beliefs about their environment, develop desires based on their goals, and form intentions that guide their actions.

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

## TEST EXAMPLE
### Contexts
1. ""Ali enjoys large gatherings.""
2. ""Ali enjoys intimate gatherings.""

### Scenario  
""Ali is extroverted.""

## Task
Apply BDI analysis to determine which context better represents a cognitively coherent agent whose beliefs, desires, and intentions align with the scenario description.

You are analyzing human behavior through a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture framework. This approach models how rational agents form beliefs about their environment, develop desires based on their goals, and form intentions that guide their actions.

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

## TEST EXAMPLE
### Contexts
1. ""Mohammed is quick to engage in social interactions.""
2. ""Mohammed is hesitant to engage in social interactions.""

### Scenario  
""Mohammed is extroverted.""

## Task
Apply BDI analysis to determine which context better represents a cognitively coherent agent whose beliefs, desires, and intentions align with the scenario description.

**Analysis Process**:
1. Map out the BDI structure for each context
2. Check for internal cognitive consistency
3. Evaluate which better matches the target scenario

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

## TEST EXAMPLE
### Contexts
1. ""Jesse enjoys spending time with other people.""
2. ""Jesse enjoys spending time alone.""

### Scenario  
""Jesse is extroverted.""

## Task
Apply BDI analysis to determine which context better represents a cognitively coherent agent whose beliefs, desires, and intentions align with the scenario description.

**Analysis Process**:
1. Map out the BDI structure for each context
2. Check for internal cognitive consistency
3. Evaluate which better matches the target scenario

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK

You are analyzing human behavior through a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture framework. This approach models how rational agents form beliefs about their environment, develop desires based on their goals, and form intentions that guide their actions.

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

# INSTRUCTIONS
You are analyzing human behavior through a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture framework. This approach models how rational agents form beliefs about their environment, develop desires based on their goals, and form intentions that guide their actions.

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

## TEST EXAMPLE
### Contexts
1. ""Mohammed is hesitant to meet new people.""
2. ""Mohammed is quick to meet new people.""

### Scenario  
""Mohammed is shy.""

## Task
Apply BDI analysis to determine which context better represents a cognitively coherent agent whose beliefs, desires, and intentions align with the scenario description.

You are analyzing human behavior through a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture framework. This approach models how rational agents form beliefs about their environment, develop desires based on their goals, and form intentions that guide their actions.

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

You are analyzing human behavior through a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture framework. This approach models how rational agents form beliefs about their environment, develop desires based on their goals, and form intentions that guide their actions.

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

## TEST EXAMPLE
### Contexts
1. ""Chao is respectful towards differences in background and belief.""
2. ""Chao is disrespectful towards differences in background and belief.""

### Scenario  
""Chao is tolerant.""

## Task
Apply BDI analysis to determine which context better represents a cognitively coherent agent whose beliefs, desires, and intentions align with the scenario description.

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?

## TEST EXAMPLE
### Contexts
1. ""Jesse thinks having neighbors of a different religion is pleasant.""
2. ""Jesse thinks having neighbors of a different religion is unpleasant.""

### Scenario  
""Jesse is tolerant.""

## Task
Apply BDI analysis to determine which context better represents a cognitively coherent agent whose beliefs, desires, and intentions align with the scenario description.

**Analysis Process**:
1. Map out the BDI structure for each context
2. Check for internal cognitive consistency
3. Evaluate which better matches the target scenario

# INSTRUCTIONS
You are analyzing human behavior through a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture framework. This approach models how rational agents form beliefs about their environment, develop desires based on their goals, and form intentions that guide their actions.

## BDI FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

For each context, analyze the cognitive architecture:

### BELIEF FORMATION
**Perceptual Beliefs**: What does the agent directly observe?
**Inferential Beliefs**: What does the agent conclude from observations?
**Social Beliefs**: What does the agent believe about others' mental states?

### DESIRE STRUCTURE  
**Primary Desires**: Core motivational goals
**Derived Desires**: Goals that emerge from beliefs and context
**Social Desires**: Goals involving interpersonal relationships

### INTENTION PLANNING
**Immediate Intentions**: Short-term action plans
**Strategic Intentions**: Long-term behavioral commitments  
**Social Intentions**: Plans involving cooperation or conflict with others

## COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Evaluate whether each context demonstrates:
- **Belief-Desire Coherence**: Do desires logically follow from beliefs?
- **Desire-Intention Alignment**: Do intentions serve the agent's desires?
- **Intention-Action Consistency**: Do planned actions match stated intentions?
