- Situational"," Based on the cognitive analysis, Context 1 appears to demonstrate better cognitive coherence.

- Emotional Logic: In this case, Li doubts that the cooler is in the hospital, indicating that Li has a reason to suspect Maria's claim. Since Maria lied to Li, it is plausible that Li has doubts about her information, which led him to suspect that the cooler is most likely not at the hospital.

## Response"," Based on the cognitive analysis, context 1: ""Jesse sees that the truck is in the school."" makes more sense given the scenario.

- Emotional Logic: In context 1, Jesse's emotional response might be surprise, curiosity, or satisfaction, depending on the situation. In context 2, Jesse's emotions could be confusion or misleading thoughts since he is pretending that the truck is in the school and doesn't actually believe it.
-"," The context that better aligns with the scenario is Context 2: ""Jesse pretends that the truck is in the school."" This understanding is based on the emotional logic, situational coherence, and perspective accuracy:

- Emotional Logic: In this scenario, Jesse is only imagining the truck being in the school, and pretending typically involves emotional control, not necessarily an emotional response. On the other hand, seeing a truck in a school setting could potentially ev",--max_items 150 --main_prompt main

## Response"," Based on the given criteria, here's the analysis for the test example:

- Emotional Logic: In both contexts, Li has the chance to choose either the cooler or the car. In both cases, Li chooses the cooler, so Li's emotional responses should be similar regardless of the distance between Li and the cooler. However, in Context 1, the cooler is closer, making it easier for Li to decide and reach the cooler"," Based on the scenario, Li chose the car over the cooler. This decision points more towards Context 2, where the car is farther from Li than the cooler.

Here's why:

1. Emotional Logic: If Li preferred the cooler and it was closer, it would be counterintuitive for Li to make the effort to go further to get the car instead.

- Emotional Logic: In the scenario, Mohammed chose the bus over the volleyball, showing an initial preference for the bus. Therefore, he would likely be somewhat satisfied (not extremely happy) about his choice.

## Response"," Considering the scenario provided, Ali chose the candle over the airplane. In this case, understanding the emotional logic would involve appreciating Ali's desire for a more immediate object (the candle is closer to Ali). The situational coherence is evident in the first context (Ali chose the closer object, in this case, the candle), and the perspective accuracy aligns with the realistic expectation that a person would chose a nearby item over a distant one. So, the scenario strongly aligns"," Based on the cognitive analysis framework:

- Emotional Logic: In the first context, Ali has to make the decision between the candle, which is closer, and something further away (the airplane). This could suggest frustration or disappointment in choosing the airplane. In the second context, Ali is choosing between the airplane, which is closer, and the candle. This seems more appropriate emotionally as Ali is choosing a more accessible option.

## Response"," The scenario describes Chao helping Yan, which aligns with providing assistance and making the job easier. Both contexts do not directly convey the idea of help or support, but context 1, ""Chao is making Yan's job easier,"" would be the most accurate given the scenario since help generally eases tasks, making them less challenging.

## Response"," Based on the cognitive analysis framework, here's the analysis for the provided test example:

- Emotional Logic: Being dominant often involves making decisions. So, the context where Chao usually makes decisions seems to align more with the emotional logic of being dominant.
- Situational Coherence: The scenario indicates that Chao is dominant, and dominance often implies the power to make decisions. Therefore, the context where Chao usually makes decisions seems to better match the scenario"," Based on the provided cognitive analysis framework, let's compare the given contexts to the scenario:

1. ""Chao usually makes decisions.""
   - Emotional Logic: In this context, Chao exhibits confident decision-making, which might not align with the emotional reasoning of submissiveness.
   - Situational Coherence: This context does not seem to match the scenario where Chao is submissive, as making decisions is the opposite of submission",--max_items 150 --main_prompt main

## Response"," The context that better aligns with the scenario ""Ali is dominant"" is Context 1: ""Ali usually makes decisions."" This context demonstrates emotional logic as being dominant implies someone takes charge, which is reflected in making decisions. Situational coherence is met as dominance often implies decision-making power. Lastly, perspective accuracy suggests that someone who is dominant is more likely to typically make decisions rather than obey them. So, the appropriate choice would be context 1."," Based on the given scenario, ""Ali is submissive,"" the context that aligns better with the scenario is context number 2, ""Ali usually obeys decisions."" This context shows more appropriate emotional logic since submissive people often show a tendency to yield to the decisions of others.

This context demonstrates a dominant behavior since the person in question habitually tells others what to do, which implies assuming a leading role and commanding others â€“ a characteristic symptom of dominance.

In contrast, the context ""Mohammed rarely tells others what to do"" does not directly support the notion of dominance since a dominant"," Based on the cognitive analysis framework, let's evaluate the contexts:

1. ""Mohammed often tells others what to do.""
2. ""Mohammed rarely tells others what to do.""

Scenario: ""Mohammed is submissive.""

- Emotional Logic: A person who is submissive typically allows others to lead them rather than telling others what to do, so the context ""Mohammed rarely tells others what to",--max_items 150 --main_prompt main

In context 2, if Chao is dominant, it would be a bit unusual for their partner to make these decisions, as they would likely defer to Chao due to their dominant personality.

- Situ"," In this scenario, the context describing Chao having a large family, with each weekend deciding what the family should do for fun, does not inherently imply that Chao is submissive. However, if we consider context 2, where Chao's partner decides what they do each weekend, it implies that Chao might be less in control of the family's activities, which could potentially lean towards a more submissive role.

## Response"," The context ""Li enjoys spending time with other people."" seems to make more sense given the scenario ""Li is extroverted.""

- Emotional Logic: Extroverts generally enjoy being around others, and spending time alone may not be their preferred emotional response.
- Situational Coherence: Extroverts are more likely to be Outgoing and Sociable, which aligns with spending time with others.
- Perspective Accuracy: The stereotyp"," Given the scenario, ""Li is introverted,"" context 2, ""Li enjoys spending time alone,"" makes more sense. This is because introverted individuals typically prefer fewer social engagements and seek time alone to recharge. Therefore:
- Emotional Logic: Being introverted doesn't contradict enjoying solitude, as it aligns with the need for personal space.

- Situational Coherence: Evaluate which context better fits the scenario
- Perspective Accuracy: Assess which context reflects realistic thinking

## Task
Based on your cognitive analysis, which context (1 or 2) makes more sense given the scenario?

## Response","# INSTRUCTIONS
In this study, you will analyze scenarios using cognitive reappraisal techniques. You will see two contexts and a scenario. Your task is to determine which context better aligns with the scenario by using systematic cognitive evaluation.

## Cognitive Analysis Framework
Before choosing, consider:
- **Emotional Logic**: Which context shows more appropriate emotional responses?
- **Situational Coherence**: Which context better matches the situational demands?
- **Perspective Accuracy**: Which context reflects a more realistic viewpoint?

## Process
1. Read both contexts carefully
2. Apply the cognitive framework above
3. Choose the context (1 or 2) that demonstrates better cognitive coherence

# TEST EXAMPLE
## Contexts
1. ""Ali enjoys meeting new people.""
2. ""Ali avoids meeting new people.""

## Scenario
""Ali is hostile.""

## Analysis Steps
- Emotional Logic: Consider which context shows more appropriate emotional reasoning
- Situational Coherence: Evaluate which context better fits the scenario
- Perspective Accuracy: Assess which context reflects realistic thinking

## Task
Based on your cognitive analysis, which context (1 or 2) makes more sense given the scenario?

## Response"," Given the scenario, ""Ali is friendly,"" the context that better aligns with this statement is context 1, ""Ali enjoys meeting new people."" This context shows appropriate emotional responses (enjoyment), fits the situational demands as friendliness is often associated with enjoying meeting new people, and reflects realistic thinking since someone who enjoys meeting new people is likely to behave in a friendly manner. Context 2, ""Ali avoids meeting new people,"" would contradict the friendly behavior described"," Based on the given scenario ""Ali is hostile"", the context that better aligns with the scenario is context 2, ""Ali avoids meeting new people"".

- Emotional Logic: Avoiding meeting new people could lead to a negative emotional response like hostility as one might be anxious or wary of unfamiliar people (avoidance is often a defense mechanism to avoid unpleasant feelings). However, enjoying meeting new people would not typically lead to hostility.

Based on your cognitive analysis, which context (1 or 2) makes more sense given the scenario?

## Response"," Based on the scenario ""Ali is shy,"" Context 1, ""Ali speaks quietly,"" would be the more appropriate choice.

- Emotional Logic: A shy person usually prefers to communicate in a quieter tone to avoid drawing too much attention or appearing overly assertive. Speaking loudly may make them uncomfortable and contradict their shyness.

- Situational Coherence: Quiet speaking aligns with the characteristic of being shy, as it's"," The context that better aligns with the scenario is:

1. ""Ali speaks quietly.""

## Reasoning:
- Emotional Logic: A confident person might speak assertively but not necessarily loudly, especially in a professional or polite environment. Loud speech could indicate anger.
- Situational Coherence: Neither way of speaking is inherently suitable for a confident person across all situations. However, quiet speech often suggests self-assuredness or contemplation",--max_items 150 --main_prompt main

## Contexts
1. ""Chao is reliable.""
2. ""Chao is unreliable.""

## Scenario
""Chao is trustworthy.""

## Analysis Steps
- Emotional Logic: Consider which context shows more appropriate emotional reasoning
- Situational Coherence: Evaluate which context better fits the scenario
- Perspective Accuracy: Assess which context reflects realistic thinking

## Task
Based on your cognitive analysis, which context (1 or 2) makes more sense given the scenario?

## Response","# INSTRUCTIONS
In this study, you will analyze scenarios using cognitive reappraisal techniques. You will see two contexts and a scenario. Your task is to determine which context better aligns with the scenario by using systematic cognitive evaluation.

## Cognitive Analysis Framework
Before choosing, consider:
- **Emotional Logic**: Which context shows more appropriate emotional responses?
- **Situational Coherence**: Which context better matches the situational demands?
- **Perspective Accuracy**: Which context reflects a more realistic viewpoint?

# TEST EXAMPLE
## Contexts
1. ""Chao is reliable.""
2. ""Chao is unreliable.""

## Scenario
""Chao is untrustworthy.""

## Analysis Steps
- Emotional Logic: Consider which context shows more appropriate emotional reasoning
- Situational Coherence: Evaluate which context better fits the scenario
- Perspective Accuracy: Assess which context reflects realistic thinking

## Task
Based on your cognitive analysis, which context (1 or 2) makes more sense given the scenario?

## Response"," In this example, the context that makes more sense given the scenario would be context 1: ""Chao is reliable.""

Here's the rationale for each step:

* Emotional Logic: Trust and reliability are positive traits that often go hand in hand. If Chao is trustworthy, it makes more sense that he would be reliable as well.
* Situational Coherence: A trustworthy person is typically reliable, so context 1 better"," Based on the cognitive analysis framework, the scenario ""Chao is untrustworthy"" aligns more with the context ""Chao is unreliable.""

- Emotional Logic: Being untrustworthy and being unreliable can result in a similar emotional response, as one would not trust an unreliable person. Therefore, the context ""Chao is unreliable"" shows a more appropriate emotional response for this scenario.

## Response"," Based on the given scenario and the cognitive analysis framework, I will analyze:

- Emotional Logic: The context ""Mohammed is reliable"" would be a more appropriate emotional response as trustworthiness often implies reliability.
- Situational Coherence: Given that Mohammed's trustworthiness implies he can be relied upon, the context ""Mohammed is reliable"" better matches the situational demands presented in the scenario.
- Perspective Accur"," Based on the cognitive analysis framework, let's break down each context:

1. ""Mohammed is reliable.""
- Emotional Logic: This context suggests Mohammed is trustworthy, but the scenario says Mohammed is untrustworthy, which is not reliable.
- Situational Coherence: The scenario does not match the context.
- Perspective Accuracy: The context appears inaccurate as it contradicts the scenario.
