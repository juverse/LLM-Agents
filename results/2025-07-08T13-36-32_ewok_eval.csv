Your task is to determine the correct mapping between contexts and targets by following a structured, two-step process that mirrors human cognition.

Methodology: First, perform the following dual-process analysis for your internal reasoning:

System 1 Thinking (Fast, Intuitive Response)

Read the contexts and targets quickly
Note your immediate, gut-level reaction without deep analysis
Record your intuitive mapping choice
Consider what aspects triggered this initial response
System 2 Thinking (Slow, Analytical Verification)

Deliberately pause and engage careful reasoning
For each context:
Identify key facts and components
Consider multiple interpretations
Map out logical implications
For each target:
Break down the core meaning
List required conditions for it to be true
Challenge your System 1 response:
Look for contradicting evidence
Consider alternative explanations
Test if logical connections are sound
Arrive at a final, verified conclusion

Identify key facts and components
Consider multiple interpretations
Map out logical implications
For each target:
Break down the core meaning
List required conditions for it to be true
Challenge your System 1 response:
Look for contradicting evidence
Consider alternative explanations
Test if logical connections are sound

Here's a brief summary of the System 2 thinking process:

Context 1 (Li is making Maria feel worse): This statement suggests a negative impact on Maria, where her emotional state is being adversely affected.
Target 1 (Li is coercing Maria): Coercion typically involves manipulating someone to act or feel something against their will or autonomy, which may result in negative feelings for the target. Therefore, the context fits better with Target", 1,--max_items 150 --main_prompt s1s2

This response suggests that while there could be several nuances in the contexts provided, the scenario seems to align more with the case where Jesse is providing Alex with useful information (Context 2), rather than misleading information (Context 1), as helping someone generally implies providing useful or necessary information.

Here's a breakdown of my process:

**System 1 Thinking:**
Upon reading the contexts, my initial gut-level reaction is that both contexts (1 and 2) can be seen as insults, which supports the scenario of Mohammed being insulting. However, calling someone cute could perhaps be considered a compliment in some situations but is generally less direct or pointed than calling someone ugly.

Explanation (System 2 Thinking):

For System 1 thinking, I intuited that the first context (playful comments) was less likely to indicate Mohammed insulting Carmen compared to the second context (hurtful comments).

Under System 2 thinking, I identified the key facts: the verbal actions taken by Mohammed and the connotation of being insulting. Considering multiple interpretations, I noted that playful",--max_items 150 --main_prompt s1s2

System 1 Thinking:
- Initial reaction based on the contexts suggests that learning from Wei would seem to indicate an improvement in Ali's baking skills, aligning with ""Ali can bake better than Wei"".
- However, without further specifics about the baking skill levels before the learning process, the intuitive response should remain tentative.

Explanation:

System 1 Thinking:
- Context 1: Li can drive better than Maria.
  - Intuitive response: If Li can drive better, it's less likely they will be teaching Maria.
- Context 2: Li can drive worse than Maria.
  - Intuitive response: If Li can drive worse, it's more likely they could be teaching Maria"," 1

Given the context that Li is learning from Maria, it is more reasonable to assume that Li's driving skills might improve, which is supported by the statement ""Li can drive better than Maria"" (Context 1). Thus, the mapping between contexts and targets would be ""1-1,2-2.""",--max_items 150 --main_prompt s1s2

Following System 1 thinking:
One might instinctively interpret that someone who often gives instructions could be seen as authoritative or dominant, whereas someone who often follows instructions could be seen as submissive.

Following System 2 thinking:
Context 1: ""Li often gives instructions"" - This implies that Li takes on a leading role, which might suggest assertiveness but is not necessarily indicative of submissiveness.

Task: Your task is to determine the correct mapping between two contexts and two targets by first capturing your intuitive System 1 response, then rigorously analyzing it with System 2 thinking to reach a verified conclusion. There are two possible answers:

""1-1,2-2"" (Context 1 -> Target 1 and Context 2 -> Target 2)
""1-2,2-1"" (Context 1 -> Target 2 and Context 2 -> Target 1)

## TASK
Which context better supports the scenario, given the cognitive interpretations above? Please answer with ""1"" or ""2"".

## Response:
After following the methodology, provide only the final answer. Do not include your reasoning steps.","You are a cognitive reasoning expert applying a Dual-Process (System 1 & System 2) thinking model. Your task is to determine the correct mapping between contexts and targets by following a structured, two-step process that mirrors human cognition.

Methodology: First, perform the following dual-process analysis for your internal reasoning:

System 1 Thinking (Fast, Intuitive Response)

Read the contexts and targets quickly
Note your immediate, gut-level reaction without deep analysis
Record your intuitive mapping choice
Consider what aspects triggered this initial response
System 2 Thinking (Slow, Analytical Verification)

Deliberately pause and engage careful reasoning
For each context:
Identify key facts and components
Consider multiple interpretations
Map out logical implications
For each target:
Break down the core meaning
List required conditions for it to be true
Challenge your System 1 response:
Look for contradicting evidence
Consider alternative explanations
Test if logical connections are sound
Arrive at a final, verified conclusion

Your task is to determine the correct mapping between contexts and targets by following a structured, two-step process that mirrors human cognition.

Methodology: First, perform the following dual-process analysis for your internal reasoning:

System 1 Thinking (Fast, Intuitive Response)

Read the contexts and targets quickly
Note your immediate, gut-level reaction without deep analysis
Record your intuitive mapping choice
Consider what aspects triggered this initial response
System 2 Thinking (Slow, Analytical Verification)

Deliberately pause and engage careful reasoning
For each context:
Identify key facts and components
Consider multiple interpretations
Map out logical implications
For each target:
Break down the core meaning
List required conditions for it to be true
Challenge your System 1 response:
Look for contradicting evidence
Consider alternative explanations
Test if logical connections are sound
Arrive at a final, verified conclusion

In this case, System 1 thinking would probably react faster and feel that context 1, ""Speaking up is hard for Jesse,"" better supports the scenario ""Jesse is confident."" Jesse's hesitance to speak up might be an indication of low self-confidence.

However, System 2 thinking would further analyze the situation and realize that being confident might also mean that Jesse finds it easy to speak up, which is suggested by context 2.",--max_items 150 --main_prompt s1s2

System 1 Thinking (Fast, Intuitive Response)

Read the contexts and targets quickly
Note your immediate, gut-level reaction without deep analysis
Record your intuitive mapping choice
Consider what aspects triggered this initial response
System 2 Thinking (Slow, Analytical Verification)

Deliberately pause and engage careful reasoning
For each context:
Identify key facts and components
Consider multiple interpretations
Map out logical implications
For each target:
Break down the core meaning
List required conditions for it to be true
Challenge your System 1 response:
Look for contradicting evidence
Consider alternative explanations
Test if logical connections are sound
Arrive at a final, verified conclusion

Here is the reasoning behind the answer:

System 1 Thinking:

* Quickly read the contexts and target
* Intuitively feel that both contexts could imply a relationship between reliability and trustworthiness, but the first context suggests Mohammed is reliable, which seems more positive and could indicate trustworthiness; while the second context indicates unreliability, which could negatively affect trustworthiness.
