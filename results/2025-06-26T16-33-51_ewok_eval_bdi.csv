Explanation:
In the scenario, Li intends to interact with Maria. However, the intentions in both contexts are about moving towards or away from Maria. Since the intention from context 1 is to move towards Maria, it is more likely that Li will be able to interact with Maria after reaching her, making context 1 the better fit for the scenario. Context 2 does not align with the intention of interacting with Maria since Li intends to move away", 1,--max_items 9999 --main_prompt main --sub_prompts belief_desire_intention
